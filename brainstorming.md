App Name: Currency Converter
- Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?

        - Mobile is essential for the traveling user who requires quick currency conversion.

        - This app would be useful to anyone who travels a lot for work or vacations, or anyone who has family in different countries. As a frame of reference, in 2018 there were 1.4 billion international tourist arrivals around the globe according the World Tourism Organization (UNTWO).

        - This app could be beneficial for international travelers who need a quick conversion while out shopping or dining while abroad.

- Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
    - How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the deadline?
        - The most challenging thing to deal with this app would be to make sure the api being pulled from is fairly up to date. Exchange rates can change frequently so it will be important to know how often the api is updated.
    - Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
        - The app itself has pretty basic functionality as-is. One way to strip-down would be to eliminate the ability to search and just make a randomizer that would provide exchange rates. This could be entertaining to build still and could be utilized by curious users.
    - How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
        - We want this app to be a searchable database for currency exchange rate. A user would search for the currency they currently have and a recyclerview would display exchange rates for different countries. We would also like the ability to search for specific country currencies.
